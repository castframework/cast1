# Explorer FRO (Financial Registrar Oracle)

The <span class="froColor">Financial Registration Oracle (FRO)</span> is designed to start the process of an issuance, declaration of investors and interests, creation of instruments, and many more procedures. <br>
<br>
At the beginning of an issuance (bond or EMNT), issuers and investors communicate their parameters to the registrar, who then sends that information to the blockchain via the FRO. This means that the FRO launches the issuance, declares the issuer and each investor, creates the instrument, and even generates the trades and settlement transactions.
