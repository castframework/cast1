## Oracles

#### FRO

Forge Registration Oracle (FRO): designed to start the process of an issuance, declaration of investors and interests, creation of instruments, and many more procedures. At the beginning of an issuance (bond or EMNT), issuers and investors communicate their parameters to the registrar, who then sends that information to the blockchain via the FRO. This means that the FRO launches the issuance, declares the issuer and each investor, creates the instrument, and even generates the trades and settlement transactions.

#### FSO

Forge Settlement Oracle (FSO): designed to provide important DvP (Delivery vs Payment) functionalities when the issuer and investor are prepared to complete the trade. This oracle can be connected to an outside entity to extend payment options.

#### FIO

Forge Investment Oracle (FIO): designed to be a listener for investors and issuers on the blockchain. This is the way in which these parties can receive information on the transactions which concern them. This oracle can be used as a source of information in order to receive accurate information on transactions.

It could also represent a share in a real estate asset or a share in an investment fund.
